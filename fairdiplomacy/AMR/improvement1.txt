We can give it back to me next year and if necessary you just disband a rearguard army to make up for it if you’re not picking up another build somewhere else.

If we decide to take out Turkey first, bounce Austria, and I’ll open as a traditional Lepanto.  Thoughts?

England send to Germany that Haha ok, glad to get the confirmation. On my end i’ll confirm I am totally anti-french until France is out of the game. I’ve actually ceased communications with France (maybe something we can all do once the stab is clear). I’d like all three of us to get our two builds each together. Then we can look east.

France send to England that Hey England, how are you? I would like to discuss an England/France alliance with you, aimed at taking Germany out quickly. I think if we work together and can trust each other, this could be an amazingly strong alliance. No matter what you decide, I think it would be in both our favor's to leave the English Channel as a DMZ. Let me know if you're interested and we can coordinate moves. Looking forwards to a great game, and good luck!
