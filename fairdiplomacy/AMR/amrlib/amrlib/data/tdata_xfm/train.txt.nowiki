# ::snt Germany!  Just the person I want to speak with. I have a somewhat crazy idea that I've always wanted to try with I/G, but I've never actually convinced the other guy to try it. And, what's worse, it might make you suspicious of me.   So...do I suggest it?  I'm thinking that this is a low stakes game, not a tournament or anything, and an interesting and unusual move set might make it more fun? That's my hope anyway.  What is your appetite like for unusual and crazy?

# ::snt Yeah, I can't say I've tried it and it works, cause I've never tried it or seen it. But how I think it would work is (a) my Spring move looks like an attack on Austria, so it would not be surprising if you did not cover Munich. Then (b) you build two armies, which looks like we're really at war and you're going to eject me. Then we launch the attack in Spring. So there is really no part of this that would raise alarm bells with France.  All that said, I've literally never done it before, and it does involve risk for you, so I'm not offended or concerned if it's just not for you. I'm happy to play more conventionally too. Up to you.

The reason is that: if I help you to Marseilles, I'm basically cut off from going west and getting anything myself. So, usually, Germany would help Italy into Marseilles to encourage Italy to come west and Germany would plan to take Paris, Belgium and Brest.

You might also suggest to Russia that is he supports you to Denmark, you will then support Russia back to Sweden. I don't know yet if it actually makes sense to do that, but you want Russia thinking that you are eager to work with him. He'll be hoping for a reason to break off his attack on you at this point.

# ::snt My thoughts on the "Germany/England forever so that at least we can stop the solo" strategy: (1) It's quite early to be talking about solos. I am at 8, and Austria could take 3 from me any time, quite easily. (2) I don't think England is thinking that way. I think he's thinking that a dominant power will emerge in the north, and one will emerge in the south. And he's like to be that dominant power.

# ::snt That's a good point, but the problem with that approach is that Brest is not guaranteed. If England cute MAO and supports with the Channel, the attack fails. I think we are better off ensuring that the Brest fleet is disbanded. If we disband that fleet and take North Sea, an English fleet in MAO really just spreads him out and allows you to take the island faster. It's not like he can get Portugal or Spain.

# ::snt I guess I'm just wondering from France's perspective why they'd *want* to stay in the game. Isn't it possible they'd rather move on with their life? That's not rhetorical, I'm wondering what your perspective is as a veteran player

# ::id dip_train_0001.217
# ::snt Here is my take: If France just wanted to go down in a blaze of glory and say "eff you" to England, he would have kept Irish Sea. He kept Pic, which is next to his home center, and gives him a chance to negotiate with both you and England.
(a / amr-empty)

# ::id dip_train_0001.218

I ask for a concession: As a show of good will, would you be willing to take only one of Liverpool or Portugal this year? (I know the Portugal request seems weird, but I like keeping France around and unless I'm mistaken they like me better than you  )

My real fear here is that knowing my moves, and with a desperate, jovial England seeking your advice, it would be so *easy* to just feed England enough info to keep me weak while you chow down on the Island.   I know this from experience: back when you were doing 50/50 shots in the south of France, I did everything I could to find out what you were planning and feed it to France. This was merely a time-buying measure, since France was outmatched and I would eventually run out of pretenses to extract your move. But I wanted to gain more dots before you took over.

# ::snt From my perspective, you were on the ropes early. France and England were teaming up on you. You lost Denmark and France had Holland and Munich surrounded. You were in serious peril.   I seriously went to extreme effort to keep you in the game. I spent hours talking with England and encouraging him to turn around and go the other way. I completely ended my eastern campaign and spent two seasons just making the voyage over to France so that he didn't have the bandwidth to continue his attack. I have vouched for you with Austria and Russia many times. I have supported Munich. And I have NEVER attacked you, even when people have asked me to do so and pledged to support me.

It is really important to me to get a build here so that I can try to keep France in check a bit. Will you agree that You get Bulgaria, I get Greece, and we can move forward with both of us at 5?  I really think that the two of us can dominate this game if we keep working together.

I wish we could get you more than one, but unfortunately the fact that you lost Vienna last turn makes that impossible.   So, it seems to me that the most important way to get you a build is to take Galicia in Spring. I don't care if I move there, or you move there, but we need to make some room around Budapest so that you can build there.

You got me to stab my long-time ally and you ended our pretty excellent 7-year run as an alliance. Russia told me he was with me if I stab Austria. England told me he wanted me to solo so long as I would "teach him" and help his along to second place. Then y'all pulled the rug out from under me. It was clever and effective. (End Part 1)

# ::snt (Part 2) At this stage, my excitement about the game has diminished quite a bit. And of course I'm happy to play on and take my lumps for falling for "Hey, I really want you to solo, just help me place second," but if you guys just want to call it a five-way draw among us and grab a beer together, while reviewing the statistics, that's really my preference.   I am outnumbered and I obviously can't solo. And I'm sure some of you in the north are eager to send everyone else flying my way, but I expect Russia and England to be careful, and so I'm not sure there is much room to move forward without simply tipping the board to Germany's favor.   I propose that we draw and hug it out.

# ::snt Okay. Fair enough. One reason it might matter is because I could open with an aggressive attack on Austria if you want to blitz him quickly (e.g., DMZ Gal and then break it). Or you could organize a bounce in Gal and then not move there. On the other hand, if you'd prefer to take out Turkey first, I could go the standard Lepanto route. I'm happy to go either way, but I'd really like to coordinate with you if you're game.  Maybe we both need a fuller picture of what is happening first. I'll begin to reach out to others now.

And of course I'm happy to play on and take my lumps for falling for "Hey, I really want you to solo, just help me place second," but if you guys just want to call it a five-way draw among us and grab a beer together, while reviewing the statistics, that's really my preference.   I am outnumbered and I obviously can't solo. And I'm sure some of you in the north are eager to send everyone else flying my way, but I expect Russia and England to be careful, and so I'm not sure there is much room to move forward without simply tipping the board to Germany's favor.   I propose that we draw and hug it out.

I think that you, Italy, and Germany are highly underestimating my ability to survive against your onslaught. You sure this is the game you want? Slowly whittling away at me until I die? Instead, I propose that we let you into the Mid Atlantic Ocean and that you help me defend Italy. I can send you past the MAO into West Med, where you can start taking dots like Tunis or Naples. We wait until AI crumbles, and you have an excellent game where you top the board."

# ::snt The anti-english moves aren't strictly anti-english. But a fleet build in Berlin and then moving to Kie is a little aggressive.  Germany hoped I would just give up denmark this fall, and that was her explanation of the kie move. Eventually that Kie fleet will be going against me. A stab right now from germany doesn't seem to make much sense though.

You got me to stab my long-time ally and you ended our pretty excellent 7-year run as an alliance. Russia told me he was with me if I stab Austria. England told me he wanted me to solo so long as I would "teach him" and help his along to second place. Then y'all pulled the rug out from under me. It was clever and effective. (End Part 1)

# ::snt (Part 2) At this stage, my excitement about the game has diminished quite a bit. And of course I'm happy to play on and take my lumps for falling for "Hey, I really want you to solo, just help me place second," but if you guys just want to call it a five-way draw among us and grab a beer together, while reviewing the statistics, that's really my preference.   I am outnumbered and I obviously can't solo. And I'm sure some of you in the north are eager to send everyone else flying my way, but I expect Russia and England to be careful, and so I'm not sure there is much room to move forward without simply tipping the board to Germany's favor.   I propose that we draw and hug it out.

# ::snt Reply all to Italy's message: First, if you didn't get a message from Italy claiming to have been sent to the whole board, please let me know. I'm down for the draw that he has proposed. I'd also like to add that I'll be checking the "Adjudicate once all powers have issued orders" box. If everyone does this maybe we don't have to wait until Sunday night to have this resolved! I'm not so confident as to issue a hold for all of my units, but will be submitting for the 5-way draw. Really enjoyed playing with you all, but I'm exhausted and ready to finish and see the stats.

# ::snt Hey. Good game. I think folks are pretty much done. I know i'm ready to move on. The draw proposal combined with the impending end of the game was effective in making us slack on our moves a bit (e.g., russia skipped a build this year). I don't know that i can say whether you have a clear path to a solo if we were to continue. I know germany and I could at least get MAO next year, which would put pressure on Por and Spa. I think we'd all appreciate a draw though. Otherwise it will be "italy kind of won but kind of didn't because the game got cut short". Up to you though.

# ::snt Haha yeah that was kind of my thinking. Russia is a little tied up in the south, and so I don't expect aggression in the north. However, france would respond to a stab by begging for Russian (and potentially austrian and italian) assistance. So the choice next year is between containing russia or being aggressive (which would mean going for sweden or St. P). I think the builds we see this winter will make it more clear what's possible.

And if we don't get an additional supply center could mean a rebuild in Brest, which would be bad for me (adding Spain is probably a given). Have you considered the potential support of Mar from Spa s.c. ?

I'll be very curious to see moves from Russia-Italy-Austria. If they all converge in on you, this could be trouble. I doubt that level of collaboration is going to happen though.

# ::snt I'd prefer to keep neutral with russia, as fighting a war on two fronts would be a lot for me. Belgium isn't guaranteed for you this year, but I think it's likely. France will have to respect the pressure in the south from Italy. This frees me up to cut support in Pic and support you in from Nth. Then you just have to cut support in Ruh and Bur (if there's still something there in the fall).

# ::snt Okay that checks out. Thanks for your patience!  ...I was thinking of asking russia to support me into denmark this turn and offer to support them into sweden next season. I'm doing this a) to confirm for you that they're on board with the bump as you say, and b) to show that I'd like to work to build trust with them. However, if Russia already knows you and I are working together this will establish the opposite of trust. So I guess I'm asking if you think this is a good/useful idea, and also asking what russia knows about our plans?

# ::snt I'm a little worried that a clever france may let me into Pic, knowing that belgium is gone, and then move into IRI for invasion. I'd almost rather cut Pic with the channel and risk losing the channel. And my favorite option is to support ruh to bel from nth, also risking the channel. The logic is that if I lose the channel, it won't be for very long, but if I lose a home supply center, that will be very annoying. France seems pretty upset with me, so a kamikaze move to screw me over isn't out of the question.

So don't go spreading it around that my true allegiance right now is to you and Russia.   And speaking of fleet things: if you're not doing anything with Nth this turn anyway, could you help me out by supporting Hol-Bel? I think it makes sense for me to have a fleet with channel access in case you ever need support or a bounce there to keep France out. Maybe some sunny day you'd even trust me to hold it for you, though I understand if not.

I told them about your suggestion of a three-way alliance, and that I was mainly focussed on attacking the west this year but if needed I could readjust to spare somebody to support in the east.  I haven't heard back from France yet, but I am sort of playing double-agent with Italy to ensure that France can continue countering Italy's Spa/Mar plays and it just looks like luck. This keeps Italy in check until you and I make progress in the north and are better positioned to push Italy back.  I should have mentioned, but a third reason for the fleet build last turn was to keep France's trust. I figured it made sense anyway for the other two reasons I mentioned, but I did want to make sure France is willing to listen to me about Italy.

# ::snt Today at 5:11 PM, italy said to me: "If I leave Marseilles open, would you kindly use Burgundy in the Fall to help me take Marseilles? (Likely that means ordering Burgundy to Gascony to cut support)". So, it could be that both are true and Italy plans to do *neither*--rather than try to take Spa, Italy's gonna try rearranging?

And not to beat a dead horse, but: you claim you want to secure another build, but with your denmark fleet basically stuck where it is, it's not like keeping it is going to help you with that goal. That supply center's doing nothing for you except maintaining the unit bound to it. *I* on the other hand, could help you get what you want by getting another build.  If you have plans to use the denmark fleet, I'll respect them, because right now our goals are the same. But I see no point in keeping the fleet just for its own sake.  Yep, going for Bur

I encouraged this by saying that Italy's going to try for MAO this turn and they should focus on defending that.   Wrt the next couple years, my idea is this: it's crucial that you take Mao, and that I take Paris. From here, you and I can work on beating Italy out of the Iberian, such that you end up with Portugal, Marseilles, and Spain and I end up with Brest and Paris (though you can have Brest at first). From here we're well positioned to start hitting Italy on their home turf, esp. if Russia can keep hammering away at Austria

# ::id dip_train_0009.523
# ::snt Here's what I said, verbatim (it's long...hope it doesn't break the bot):  But England's desperate. Better to talk with someone than just go in blind. And I doubt they'd turn to Russia or France because neither is really close enough/powerful enough to give real help. And there's precedent for you negotiating with someone even as you stab them: France.  ...and here's the real accusation: for all your pretty words about a shared victory between you and me, you've been sneaky and you've always pitted me and England against each other to your benefit. My real fear here is that knowing my moves, and with a desperate, jovial England seeking your advice, it would be so easy to just feed England enough info to keep me weak while you chow down on the Island.   I know this from experience: back when you were doing 50/50 shots in the south of France, I did everything I could to find out what you were planning and feed it to France. This was merely a time-buying measure, since France was outmatched and I would eventually run out of pretenses to extract your move. But I wanted to gain more dots before you took over. And I assume others are like me, hence I suspect you now.   I'm offering this confession in hopes that you'll do the same. So just come clean and let's approach this thing as equals?

# ::snt So...Italy really did not take kindly to my confession. I retaliated with "if you don't trust me, so be it! But i'm not going to just roll over and let you dominate this game"  You can cement italy's trust of you in the morning by reporting that I've approached you with a plan. We can talk about what form that plan should take, or you can just feed Italy anything but the truth.   France is on board with the stab just fyi. Happy to leave Brest if they're to be believed, and I think they are.

The reason for that is that I think Italy is far more duplicitous than any of us ever realized; right now they may be promising you that you'll take centers of mine, and maybe even that you two will share a victory together. This is my guess because these are the promises they made to me not so long ago. But we both need to face facts: Italy has never hesitated to profit from discord between us, and will always aid the weaker of us at the expense of the stronger.  If you're tired of being manipulated in a game Italy feels they own, I have a proposal that might get us both destroyed, but at least we'll have stuck up for ourselves and perhaps minorly inconvenienced Italy on their path to victory. This proposal involves France, who is more than willing to use their last few turns to fight back against Italy. Trusting them may be a hard sell, but so is trusting me. If I were really trying to trick you, I wouldn't ask something so unreasonable as that you trust us both. But frankly I consider knocking Italy down a peg to be the sole most urgent thing we can do to keep this game viable for any of us.  My proposal is: NWG-Cly, Nth convoy Hol-Yor, Eng-IRI or Wal, Bel s Bre-Eng, Pic-Bre, Par-Pic, Bur-Par, Mun-Bur (I figure I'm about to lose Mun anyway, and if that happens I'll disband my Hel fleet) Next year we'll be well-positioned to boot Italy off the island and the iberian. What do you think?

# ::id dip_train_0009.554
# ::snt (this part is not for copy-pasting to Italy) I designed this plan to make it look safe for Italy to convoy Gas-Lvp. I know this is what they'd really like to do. I think we need to do everything we can to try and disrupt this. I know it's a riskier move trying to assist Bre into Mao but I think it's the right one. I also think that for *extra* insurance NWG should poke NAO, because worst-case scenario Italy doesn't try the convoy and moves Nao-Lvp and also moves Mao-Nao to bounce. This guarantees Bre makes it into Mao which strengthens our ability to take the southern holdings, and at worst only sets you back a turn in terms of kicking Italy out of Liverpool. In exchange for doing this riskier move, I agree to convoy to york instead of Edi and give up my build. That part of the fake plan is actually true

So I'll need to support you into Bre with Paris to make sure you get there. This means Burgundy will have to try for Gas unsupported, but again, if we're confident the convoy is the play i'm willing to risk it

# ::snt I've told France the new move is to Mao and France confirmed. So, the moves the plan needs from you are:  Eng s Bre-Mao (Bel will support Eng holding) Pic-Bre (Paris will support) Nwy-Swe Nwg-Nao  Let me know if you take issue with any of these, or if you ever hear back from Italy.  We have a shot that at least one of these moves will get us somewhere. But I recognize this plan is nowhere near as sure a thing as if you just cooperated with Italy. I want to give you one last chance to back out.

Right now my default inclination is to go Ukr and try to get Rum, that may change as I talk to other players.  Happy to talk about trying to take that with fleet or army depending on how spring goes, and certainly not looking to commit to any particular long-term growth direction right now.  That being said, A/R is one of my favorite duos (R/F is up there too, but I don't think I've ever even seriously tried to pull that off in an online game - that's a FtF option where I know the players  ).   I'm assuming standard Galicia bounce right now. happy to discuss other options.

# ::snt Reply all to Italy's message: First, if you didn't get a message from Italy claiming to have been sent to the whole board, please let me know. I'm down for the draw that he has proposed. I'd also like to add that I'll be checking the "Adjudicate once all powers have issued orders" box. If everyone does this maybe we don't have to wait until Sunday night to have this resolved! I'm not so confident as to issue a hold for all of my units, but will be submitting for the 5-way draw. Really enjoyed playing with you all, but I'm exhausted and ready to finish and see the stats.

# ::snt No. If you're asking everybody this, can you let me know what you hear back? I texted the admin to see if 1) draw settings are somehow disabled and 2) if 1909 is still going to be the last year. Part of me thinks maybe italy is turning down the draw. Make people think the game is over and then still try to scoop up centers

# ::snt I have, in fact, asked everyone. Thus far, Russia and Germany say they didn't veto.
(a / amr-empty)

# ::id dip_train_0013.47
# ::snt Yeah. I honestly don't think it's out of the question that draws are disabled (though i don't know the site well enough to know whether this would be obvious to us i.e. draw settings disabled). But like if you're running a study and want to get data, maybe you make it so people can't end the game early and get their $25 right away.
(a / amr-empty)

# ::id dip_train_0013.48

# ::id dip_train_0013.50
# ::snt Yeah. Well, I'll let you know when I hear back from the admin. I feel like italy is the only one with the incentive to not draw. If everyone gets lazy on their moves, he can try to keep scooping up centers.

(a / amr-empty)

# ::id dip_train_0016.77
# ::snt That's correct - it will only pass if it's unanimous, or at least until everyone's draw setting is compatible.  For example, if four set it as four way draw, and one set as surrender, that's compatible with a four way draw excluding the surrendering power

I'd also like to add that I'll be checking the "Adjudicate once all powers have issued orders" box. If everyone does this maybe we don't have to wait until Sunday night to have this resolved!

He was first to reach out, standard fairly neutral greeting and fishing for info, noncommittal on plans  beyond bouncing Galicia and trying not to anger any of his neighbors.  I could go either way on that one.  Life is a little easier for us if we clear that early. So far the only player that strikes me as a bit of a wildcard is Italy.

Eliminating England ASAP and there's a possibility we can end up in a draw once AI tensions build. But that is impossible if they see a weak north full of infighting that they can just roll over- then they have no reason to ever turn on eachother.

# ::snt Yes, depending on how the spring plays out I may be in a position to support you into Belgium. I don't think it would be conditional on something you do, but rather if it makes sense given the positions in the Fall. Maybe building an army in London rather than a fleet, which likely compliments your goals anyway given the channel DMZ. I think you are right in that Germany would not want to see you in Belgium. If it will antagonize him anyway, it might make sense for us to launch a full out assault in the Fall (this would probably look like bouncing Holland to weaken the German position).

I'm not holding myy breath on Ruhr, so I think the best play might be to send Belgium to Holland with support from the north sea while Denmark hits Kiel with support from Helgoland. If Germany makes similar moves to her last turn, we would pop both Kiel and Holland and would guarantee Munich/Berlin for next year. If Germany supports Kiel instead of moving to Ruhr, then we would guarantee Kiel in the fall as I'd walk into Ruhr and we would have Ruhr, Holland, Helgoland, and Denmark for a 4V3.

# ::snt I can stop Italy this turn by the way. It's pretty easy since Italy let me into Marseilles, I can support the hold in Marseilles and Marseilles can support MAO to Spain SC. It's impossible to breach, I've checked it, and I can keep making those orders for years and years. You stabbed me in Spring 03. It is Fall 05. I think that you, Italy, and Germany are highly underestimating my ability to survive against your onslaught. You sure this is the game you want? Slowly whittling away at me until I die? Instead, I propose that we let you into the Mid Atlantic Ocean and that you help me defend Italy. I can send you past the MAO into West Med, where you can start taking dots like Tunis or Naples. We wait until AI crumbles, and you have an excellent game where you top the board.

Russia is going to lose that fleet next turn I'm assuming so I literally won't have anything to do with my two fleets. If prefer to use them to help you in the west and to potentially convoy your units as needed.

This allows me to protect in case you were planning on doing something to begin with. Second, bouncing helps you out because Germany's first move with the Munich army is either to move to Burgundy or the Ruhr. If you dont move to Bur, then I'm there and you have to move the Ruhr army back to protect Mun anyway. I think we both have other issues than creating a relatively pointless stalemate here when there are better targets if we work together
