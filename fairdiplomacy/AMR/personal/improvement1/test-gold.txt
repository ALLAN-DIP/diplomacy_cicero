If you were playing more heavily, I'd suggest the opposite: tell England you'll not even contest StP if they take it with a fleet instead of an army, and instead throw all your armies at Germany, or go with me into eating Austria.  But that requires actually convincing England to go for it, and you don't got time for that shit right now.  So locking down StP should help, if you just want to move the pieces around the board.

Everyone else is talking about extremely short term arrangements. "Gunboat with a little bit of talking", basically.  There is no FG alliance, it's just that they're both fighting England... for now.  It's odd (to me).  I'm all for dynamic play, but you never get anywhere in this game if you only go it alone.

As you do Tri-Trl, I'm following into Tri to push on Venice and Piedmont.  Plus  like I said, Pru also gives you the option of convoy to Swe so your fleets are more free to move around while an army garissons your Scandinavian holdings (and even do Bal+Swe attacking Den)

# ::snt Turkey send to Russia that F Bal C Pru-Den, F Swe supports it, and either A Mun-Kie (with support from Ber) or A Ber-Kie (with Boh supporting Mun) ensures that Denmark is captured.  The only counter to that is something I doubt they're clever enough for: Bur + Ruh S Kie-Mun, Hol S Den-Kie - abandon Den in exchange for taking Mun and saving the Danish army by putting it in Kiel.

For example if you offered to convoy to Den while they drop into Bal, they'd probably do that, setting off an R/G war (not sure if you want that, but you could).

But if you have a different specific suggestion, I'm all ears.

But, that would probably also end the alliance with you and France, and they are looking in a much better position then you right now. So I would really like to continue our alliance.

# ::snt Turkey send to Russia that Hey so I ended up going to the black sea defensively because of all the info I was getting from Austria that you were planning to attack me. Not sure whether you actually are or whether you had the same sort of information from them that I was planning against you. I'm hoping its the latter as we have a great opportunity to carve up Austria given their very passive start. They should only get one build so they will be behind.

I realize that you and Austria have an alliance against me, but so far you guys haven't done that much(although I will admit you have me anoyed ). Right now, you could lie to me, tell Austria your plans, and stab me, but I think that the better option for both of us is to work together against Austria. It seems like they totally trust you, and have left many territories undefended. Currently me and Italy have an alliance, and together the 3 of us could rip through Austrias territory, as they aren't expecting it

In the short-term then you have 3 to attack RUM with. Also, you think I can hold off you, Italy and Austria at the same time? I don't, not without SEV and not after giving up the ION as you're suggesting. Also, why would I be giving up ION in this scenario anyway if not to allow your ally Italy to come back at me by sea. And I don't know where you get 9 from? 6 + 2 - 1 = 7 then you're really going to support me into RUM in the fall *as well* as the 2 I got from Austria? So you get 1 and I get 3, that's really the deal you're happy with? Still totals to 8 by the way but we both know you have no intention of supporting me into RUM in the Fall. You will be attacking RUM with 3 while Italy tries to push through by sea. It doesn't take a genius to see that. Next time try and suggest a deal that actually has some appearance of sincerity otherwise it's just too easy to see through.

I communicated with them the first year about a potential mid game alliance, as I didn't want to be the only one fighting you and Austria. But if you look at their moves, we haven't really done any work together. We haven't even communicated in years. If you look at what they have done so far, you'll see that they are a.) a very bad player or/and b.) are not at all committed to the game. They have basically communicated with nobody, haven't really attacked anyone, and had a good amount of invalid orders. At this point it doesn't make any sense for me to communicate with Italy, since they are a bad player and are going downhill fast. An alliance with you would be much better.

# ::snt Turkey send to Russia that Do you seriously think it would make any difference at all? I'm honestly asking. This game has been over for 2 seasons at least. It doesn't matter what we do now. Do you see the freebies in England? Who might be able to take those? Its first to 18 and France is on 15. Good on you for fighting to the end, but this game is over!

Meanwhile, Germany built 2 armies, used them against me to take a dot from me (I have a disband this turn), and tried to take Picardy. I'm not going to forget that.  I'm not going to attack you right now. And despite how difficult it is to predict the future in this game, I honestly don't see myself attacking you in the future either. Germany is the largest threat to me right now, and I can't overextend against you without worrying about Italy who has a fleet in Rome (which can only move West).

I wanted to put that on the table as a way to get 3 units on Belgium. If Germany plays his cards correctly there is a high chance I lose Ruhr, and that will make it hard to take Belgium. Again, I know it's a huge ask, so right now I'm sending MAO south unless you allow me to put it in the channel temporarily. If you do allow that, you would have control over what we do with that unit- whether that's convoying London to Belgium, cutting Belgium support to try and capture Holland, or sending it to Belgium with supports from Burgundy and Picardy.

# ::snt England send to France that While I reasonably hesitated to involve myself in the conflict with a Germany, the fact that I have taken Denmark (and intend to continue attacking with the fleet in Denmark) ought to indicate that I'm no longer hesitating to commit. While Turkey/Austria is a significant threat in the late game, I'm also concerned with not being eliminated in the short-term. The fact of the matter is that I am surrounded by powers who can stab me with devastating effect (you) or powers who have in fact stabbed me (Russia) or would stab if given the chance (Germany). I am more than willing to hit Germany right now and move South from Denmark, but I also need to cover my bases and get Nor. Russia can have centers in Germany to combat AT.
