# ::snt SEN send to REC that I basically sent this to Austria, I've replaced the pronouns so that it makes sense to you:   Ok, I now realize that there's no Western Triple.  Instead, it's an FG - which is just as bad for you guys, since Germany is already into Russia.  Here's my idea, and take it or leave it ... but I suggest that REC keep rotating his fleets out (maybe move towards WES and TUN) while Austria backfills ION.  REC builds a fleet in ROM and Austria can convoy Greece into NAP in the Spring.  Now REC's got three fleets in play while France is trying to land a unit on England.  Meanwhile, Austria moves the army out of SER and towards Munich and I move BUL/RUM north into SEV, MOS, and WAR.  It's a logical expansion for all of us and presents each of us with room to grow and peace in the Balkans.

# ::snt SEN send to REC that The key to not losing to the solo is - assuming the loss of Portugal (which is two coin flips) - not losing 2 of the 3 Russian centers.  You're going to lose STP.  The question then becomes, how to we preserve Warsaw?  My recommendation is:  A: VIE S TYR - BOH A: WAR - UKR A: STP - MOS A: BUD - GAL I: TYR - BOH I: TRI - TYR I: VEN - PIE I: TUS S VEN - PIE T: SEV - UKR T: RUM S WAR - UKR T: ANK - SEV (Convoy)  This plan destroys UKR or ensures that we control it.  It places units in places that they can cut supports on Warsaw which dramatically increases our odds of taking it back if we loose it or maintaining it if we don't.  Chances are, if STP is dislodged, it will be able to retreat to LVN.    Worst case is that Germany just rotates his armies north - supporting himself into LVN and getting three on Warsaw (LVN, PRU, and SIL.  But, we'll either be in Moscow or Galicia (probably both) and Ukraine.  We'll also have two on Munich and he can either keep munich or go after Warsaw.  The other option is to support ourselves into Galicia and Ukraine.  I'm willing to do as you suggest.

I agree with a DMZ in Piedmont and Gulf of Tyrolia, and we might as well extend it to Western Mediterranean and North Africa. But I hope you understand how unreasonable for you to expect me not to move the Spain, as it is a typical SEN acquisition. Also I can't build a fleet in Piedmont... Anyways, Good luck, and have fun!

# ::id dip_validation_0014.67
# ::snt SEN send to REC that Ok, I now realize that there's no Western Triple.  Instead, it's an FG - which is just as bad for you guys, since Germany is already into Russia.  Here's my idea, and take it or leave it ... but I suggest that he keep rotating his fleets out (maybe move towards WES and TUN) while you backfill ION.  He builds a fleet in ROM and you convoy him into NAP in the Spring.  Now he's got three fleets in play while France is trying to land a unit on England.  Meanwhile, you move your army out of SER and towards Munich and I move BUL/RUM north into SEV, MOS, and WAR.  It's a logical expansion for all of us and presents each of us with room to grow and peace in the Balkans.

# ::snt SEN send to REC that The key to not losing to the solo is - assuming the loss of Portugal (which is two coin flips) - not losing 2 of the 3 Russian centers.  You're going to lose STP.  The question then becomes, how to we preserve Warsaw?  My recommendation is:  A: VIE S TYR - BOH A: WAR - UKR A: STP - MOS A: BUD - GAL I: TYR - BOH I: TRI - TYR I: VEN - PIE I: TUS S VEN - PIE T: SEV - UKR T: RUM S WAR - UKR T: ANK - SEV (Convoy)  This plan destroys UKR or ensures that we control it.  It places units in places that they can cut supports on Warsaw which dramatically increases our odds of taking it back if we loose it or maintaining it if we don't.  Chances are, if STP is dislodged, it will be able to retreat to LVN.    Worst case is that Germany just rotates his armies north - supporting himself into LVN and getting three on Warsaw (LVN, PRU, and SIL.  But, we'll either be in Moscow or Galicia (probably both) and Ukraine.  We'll also have two on Munich and he can either keep munich or go after Warsaw.  The other option is to support ourselves into Galicia and Ukraine.  I'm willing to do as you suggest.
