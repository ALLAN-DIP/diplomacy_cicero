I know I've been... aggressive to you in the past, and I know that chances are you won't believe me or agree to work with me, but if you hear me out we both can gain from this (and utterly destroy England in the process). I'll retreat from Burgundy this Spring, and I'll agree to not invade any more territories of yours until all of England is destroyed. I'm assuming you're going to build a fleet in Brest, and if you do so and move Bre --> Eng in the spring it would cut any support that fleet could provide and I can kick England out of the North Sea. From there I can help support you in to the English Channel or we could work to convoy an army into the British Isles in the next few years. I hope you consider.

If you were playing more heavily, I'd suggest the opposite: tell England you'll not even contest StP if they take it with a fleet instead of an army, and instead throw all your armies at Germany, or go with me into eating Austria.  But that requires actually convincing England to go for it, and you don't got time for that shit right now.  So locking down StP should help, if you just want to move the pieces around the board.

War-Pru, and I'm giving you Tri now, for your build, but basically right after, you should be doing Boh S Tri-Trl, and you're right smack on where you need to be with all of Trl, Boh, Sil, Pru, and Ber.  As you do Tri-Trl, I'm following into Tri to push on Venice and Piedmont.  Plus  like I said, Pru also gives you the option of convoy to Swe so your fleets are more free to move around while an army garissons your Scandinavian holdings (and even do Bal+Swe attacking Den)

We really didn't help outlet position with this mildly entangled mess in Austria.  As for you keeping Vienna long term: it is all about moving our alliance forward.  Currently you need the builds, so I got you into Vie and then Tri.  You're fighting three enemies.  But as you focus on just two, and I come into contact with France, I'll need the builds just as much, so we'll just keep track of where we need those builds to come from as we press forward!

I figured worst case scenario: you still kill the entire west, I rule the east.  You realize you're *still* closer to Gibraltar than I am!  So yeah, I didn't think you were *planning* to screw me, I just looked at the map and saw: what if England and France just *gave him* the win?  Can't I just cover my ass so even if he grows by 4 next year, I'm still ok?

So I'm game to try and out guess them with you, but I think Russia is looking for an ally anywhere.  If you offered an alliance with them (real or fake) they would probably take it.  For example if you offered to convoy to Den while they drop into Bal, they'd probably do that, setting off an R/G war (not sure if you want that, but you could).

Yeah, it's not that I don't trust you to DMZ Burgundy, but I can't think of a reason not to make the move honestly since it completely protects me against both you and Italy and still leaves room for us to work together. In that sense it leaves me some flexibility to decide my intentions in the fall- the truth is that I currently have no intentions and will let my targets pick themselves.

Even though I feel bad I REALLY needed the build as Austria and Turkey are running a relentless attack against me. I appreciate you're cooperation. I fear if we go to war, I will be pressured from all sides and will be eliminated. But, that would probably also end the alliance with you and France, and they are looking in a much better position then you right now. So I would really like to continue our alliance.

# ::snt Sev is too dangerous because Sev to Arm together with your ally Italy by sea and its basically and I just lost Austria as an ally. In the short-term then you have 3 to attack RUM with. Also, you think I can hold off you, Italy and Austria at the same time? I don't, not without SEV and not after giving up the ION as you're suggesting. Also, why would I be giving up ION in this scenario anyway if not to allow your ally Italy to come back at me by sea. And I don't know where you get 9 from? 6 + 2 - 1 = 7 then you're really going to support me into RUM in the fall *as well* as the 2 I got from Austria? So you get 1 and I get 3, that's really the deal you're happy with? Still totals to 8 by the way but we both know you have no intention of supporting me into RUM in the Fall. You will be attacking RUM with 3 while Italy tries to push through by sea. It doesn't take a genius to see that. Next time try and suggest a deal that actually has some appearance of sincerity otherwise it's just too easy to see through.

# ::snt Well... that was harsh. Let me just put a few things straight. Me and Italy is not a thing. I communicated with them the first year about a potential mid game alliance, as I didn't want to be the only one fighting you and Austria. But if you look at their moves, we haven't really done any work together. We haven't even communicated in years. If you look at what they have done so far, you'll see that they are a.) a very bad player or/and b.) are not at all committed to the game. They have basically communicated with nobody, haven't really attacked anyone, and had a good amount of invalid orders. At this point it doesn't make any sense for me to communicate with Italy, since they are a bad player and are going downhill fast. An alliance with you would be much better.

# ::snt Look. You helped me out a ton last turn my moving out of the English Channel and building the fleet in Edinburgh. Meanwhile, Germany built 2 armies, used them against me to take a dot from me (I have a disband this turn), and tried to take Picardy. I'm not going to forget that.  I'm not going to attack you right now. And despite how difficult it is to predict the future in this game, I honestly don't see myself attacking you in the future either. Germany is the largest threat to me right now, and I can't overextend against you without worrying about Italy who has a fleet in Rome (which can only move West).

Germany is trying to show discord between us because he knows it's the only chance he has to survive if we start working together. And for the record, I told him I'd be attacking you right now *if and only if* he gives me Belgium (this is a lie, but I'm hoping that I can snag Belgium this turn). I did not say anything about attacking you after splitting up Germany (and in general I like to deal with the present situation instead of making long-term plans, since the board is constantly changing).  I'll be around to talk more later today, but hopefully that assuaged some of your fears

# ::snt I will 100% do that if that is what we want to do. I don't mean to push it too much (as I realize just Picardy is a large trust excersize), but in the interest of full disclosure, I was initially planning to send MAO to the English Channel. I wanted to put that on the table as a way to get 3 units on Belgium. If Germany plays his cards correctly there is a high chance I lose Ruhr, and that will make it hard to take Belgium. Again, I know it's a huge ask, so right now I'm sending MAO south unless you allow me to put it in the channel temporarily. If you do allow that, you would have control over what we do with that unit- whether that's convoying London to Belgium, cutting Belgium support to try and capture Holland, or sending it to Belgium with supports from Burgundy and Picardy.

# ::snt Sorry for my lack of communication - been busy here. I'm leaning towards a fleet at this stage. I don't have anything on England and Germany - Germany says they are tied up and suggest I go after Russia - both things are not going to enlighten anyone who is looking at the board right now. He doesn't seem particularly concerned with his situation but I may be reading too much into that. Looks pretty scary for him right now with Russia on his doorstep as well as you and England circling.

A better way for me to handle things would have been to give you a heads up beforehand (for which I apologize).
