I think you need to stop the Nwg-Bar move, by doing Nwy-Bar.  At the same time, we need to just give you Tri so you can build another northern fleet.  We can give it back to me next year and if necessary you just disband a rearguard army to make up for it if you’re not picking up another build somewhere else.

Everything looks good right now. If you sill plan to let Russia keep Norway then I would recommend ordering North Sea-Helgoland Blight, Denmark - Kiel, and Edinburgh-North Sea.

I like that. I was thinking that you would move Bud back to Tri, but this is much better. It keeps forward momentum. And yes, you should take back Tri now. That will make builds easier as we move forward.

Also, actually, I don't have anything for Bulgaria to do, and you're guaranteed two dots this turn. Can I take Greece back too? I can bank a build for the future regardless of what happens, and you stay even. You don't really need a build right now.

Hey, so, Austria seems to want to Lepanto now.   You’re still the ally I want. And I’d like either to cut down Austria quickly or cut down Turkey quickly.   If we decide to take out Austria first, I’d like you to let Austria in to Gal (just tell him this was a mistake). This will make it very hard for him to defend against me.  If we decide to take out Turkey first, bounce Austria, and I’ll open as a traditional Lepanto.  Thoughts?

So my reasoning is that I think France is a stronger player than either of us, or at least a more engaged one. I'm getting all this tactical analysis and commentary about the state of the whole board and all that. If I help France, France probably beats me. If we defeat France together, I think we each end up with an even fighting chance.

Thanks. I would like you to re-consider my proposal. You have become a very powerful country, and if you decide to turn on Italy, there is nothing they can do between the two of us. Right now Turkey and Russia are standing each other off, and there is no immediate threat from either of them for you. Italy will be easy supply centers. I would of course support you into their territory, provided you return the favor. We could work out more details if your interested

You and Turkey are the most importand. Italy and England are basically out of the game anyways. We can definitly still stop germany, but in order for that to happen you and Turkey are going to have to stop fighting, right away, and work together to get in through germanies back door. They are sending basically all of their units to my hometown, which means they are going to be vulnerable against you guys.

Hey England, how are you? I would like to discuss an England/France alliance with you, aimed at taking Germany out quickly. I think if we work together and can trust each other, this could be an amazingly strong alliance. No matter what you decide, I think it would be in both our favor's to leave the English Channel as a DMZ. Let me know if you're interested and we can coordinate moves. Looking forwards to a great game, and good luck!
