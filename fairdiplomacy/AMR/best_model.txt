We can give it back to me next year and if necessary you just disband a rearguard army to make up for it if you’re not picking up another build somewhere else.

If we decide to take out Turkey first, bounce Austria, and I’ll open as a traditional Lepanto.  Thoughts?

You and I have much to talk about, and if we don't get certain things sorted out and understood between us I'm afraid that any conflict that might arise would surely sink us both.  First thing's first, I would greatly prefer if we could keep  Silesia and Prussia demilitarized, as well as Bohemia should such a situation arise.

SEN send to REC that Hello France, I too am interested in moving east with you and I think a channel DMZ is a great idea.  I'll be doing a fairly standard English opening so let's see how russia and germany open to plan tactics next season.
